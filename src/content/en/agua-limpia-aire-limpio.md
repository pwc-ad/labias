**_Agua limpia, aire limpio_** is a generative artwork exploring the simulation of a digital ecosystem inspired by the behaviours of natural habitats. An algorithmic homage to biodiversity that reflects the need to embrace our natural world as essential to humanity’s survival. The work stands as a meditation on coexistence, adaptation, and the quiet intelligence of a living pond.

**TAMAAINA** is an artist duo formed by **Tamara Moura Costa** (Buenos Aires, 1996) and **Christopher Ainako Legaspi** (Hilo, Hawaiʻi, 1983). Their collaborative practice bridges sound, light, and materials to explore the evolving relationship between nature, ancestry, and technological awareness.

Blending Tamara’s background in Electronic Arts and Classical Music with Christopher’s expertise in Audio Synthesis and Creative Technology, they create immersive works that merge organic and digital worlds through performance, installation, and generative art.

Their projects reflect a shared vision grounded in ecological consciousness, ancestral wisdom, and technological experimentation, inviting reflection, play, and connection across cultures and species.
