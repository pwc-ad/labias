**_Sedimental_** is a sensorial journey where earth and mind intertwine. With a subtle, suggestive structure, the short film explores how memories and emotions settle within our psyche, shaping who we become. An object unearthed in childhood unleashes a supernatural presence that grows alongside the protagonists, as matter and dreamlike visions merge into an ever-shifting identity. Between the physical and the mental, between decay and revelation, a latent question surfaces: What grows from what we leave unsaid?

Technique: Video editing based on a poem written by Gonzalo Tello, transformed into videos generated with AI, mainly using the Luma.ai and RunwayML platforms. Images were edited and clips composed in After Effects. The audio is a blend of binaural frequencies, storm recordings, and music programmed in Ableton Live.

**Gonzalo Tello** works with the image as a territory where memory, perception, and matter overlap. His practice moves between video and digital experimentation, seeking to reveal sensitivity in the processes of visual transformation. Based in Buenos Aires, his work combines technical exploration with poetic sensibility, focusing on texture, rhythm, and transformation as visual languages.
